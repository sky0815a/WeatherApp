## Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous sections try and breakdown the logic further into stateless/stateful components. 

| Component | Description | 
| --- | :---: |  
| App | This will make the initial data pull and include React Router| 
| Images | Return weater image base on the data called| 
| RightBottomRainCheck | Return outfit recommandation & things to pack before going outside base on the Feel-Like Temperature | 
| RightBottomTempWarning| Return actual Feel-Like Temperature | 
| TopRight| Weather outside decription & caution alert | 

## Time Frames


| Component | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| --- | :---: |  :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Adding Form | H | 3hrs| 3.5hrs | 3.5hrs |
| Working with API | H | 3hrs| 2.5hrs | 2.5hrs |
| Total | H | 6hrs| 5hrs | 5hrs |

## Additional Libraries
 Axios, React


## Code Snippet

	Converting Temp Unit, F = (K - 273.15) * 1.8 + 32
	Math.round((data.main.temp - 273.15) * 1.8 + 32)}FÂ°


## Issues and Resolutions
	Poor artistic app decorations


## Future plahns
	Making the serach bar functional with Zip code
